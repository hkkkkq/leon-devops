All https certs should place on certs folder, and must be small letter (CANNOT capital letter).

example structure of certs folder:
+certs
    +9393
        9393.world.crt
        9393.world.key
    +mango
        h1717.vip.crt
        h1717.vip.key
    
    default.key
    default.crt




When my program start, I will found all file extension '.key'

for example : I found 'hello.com.key'.
It will assume the certs' file name is 'hello.com.crt'
